# Sawtooth PoET

The Sawtooth PoET consensus engine implements a CFT (Crash Fault Tolerant) variant of PoET which does not use a TEE. A future version of the consensus engine which also implements full BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) features using an SGX enclave is in development.

The current PoET specification is available in
